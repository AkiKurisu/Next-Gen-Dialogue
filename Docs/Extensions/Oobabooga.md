# Oobabooga Extension Explanation
I found that interactive dialogue generation is very mature, such as Oobabooga Text-Generation-WebUI, which can export history records as json. We can first generate real-time dialogue history records and then import them into the dialogue tree.
## Features
Import Oobabooga's history

## How to use 
Add ```Editor/Experimental/Novel/OobaboogaSessionModule``` to the Dialogue node, right-click the view and click ```Load Oobabooga Session```, and select the history records in the Logs folder of Text-Generation-WebUI to import.
